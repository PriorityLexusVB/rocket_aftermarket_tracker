# 📊 Scheduling & Assignments Deep Audit

> **Status**: ✅ **COMPLIANT** - Codebase follows vendor-only scheduling rules  
> **Date**: 2025-11-15  
> **Branch**: `copilot/audit-scheduling-assignments`

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Validate that the `rocket_aftermarket_tracker` codebase follows Rob's business rule:

> **"Calendar scheduling is vendor-based only. Sales consultant, finance manager, and delivery coordinator are metadata only, never required for scheduling and never used in conflict checks."**

## ✅ Key Findings

### Overall Result
**🟢 COMPLIANT** - The system correctly implements vendor-only scheduling.

### What's Working
- ✅ Database: `job_parts` table correctly stores vendor_id + time windows for scheduling
- ✅ RPCs: Both calendar functions use ONLY vendor_id + time for queries and conflicts
- ✅ Forms: All 3 forms treat people assignments as optional (no validation requires them)
- ✅ Views: All calendar views filter by vendor + time, not people fields
- ✅ Conflicts: Detection uses ONLY vendor_id + time windows (no people fields)

### Issues Found

#### 🟡 Medium Priority (1)
**"Quick Assign" Status Bug**
- **File**: `src/pages/currently-active-appointments/index.jsx:443`
- **Issue**: Sets `status='scheduled'` without adding actual scheduling data (vendor + time)
- **Impact**: Creates jobs with "scheduled" status that aren't on the calendar
- **Fix**: Change status to 'assigned' or require actual scheduling data

#### 🟢 Low Priority (4)
1. **Deprecated Fields**: Job-level scheduling fields still exist (should document or drop)
2. **Held Migration**: `delivery_coordinator_id` in `_hold_dec2025/` but referenced in code
3. **Documentation**: Unclear which `vendor_id` (jobs vs job_parts) is used for conflicts
4. **Default Behavior**: `assigned_to` defaults to current user instead of null

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate (Do Now)
- [ ] Fix "Quick Assign" to not set 'scheduled' status without actual scheduling

### Short-Term (This Sprint)
- [ ] Apply `delivery_coordinator_id` migration OR add feature flag
- [ ] Document vendor_id relationships (jobs vs job_parts)
- [ ] Add deprecation comments to old scheduling fields

### Long-Term (Next Quarter)
- [ ] Drop deprecated job-level scheduling columns (after testing)
- [ ] Review assignment default behavior

---

## 🏆 Bottom Line

**The system architecture is sound.** ✅

- Scheduling and conflicts use vendor + time exclusively (correct ✓)
- People fields are optional metadata (correct ✓)
- No forms block saving without assignments (correct ✓)
- Calendar views work with or without assignments (correct ✓)
- Only minor status flag issue found (easy fix)

**Verdict**: No blocking issues. Safe to proceed with current architecture.
