# Conflict Resolution for PR #36

## Problem
PR #36 "WSL test setup: alias '@', supabase test stub, vitest globals" has merge conflicts with the `main` branch in three files:
- `src/lib/supabase.js`
- `src/tests/setup.ts`
- `vitest.config.ts`

## Root Cause
PR #35 "Fix Vitest configuration: resolve @ alias, enable automatic JSX, add test-safe Supabase mock" was merged to `main` first. PR #36 was created from a different branch and contains similar but slightly different implementations of the same changes.

## Resolution
The conflicts can be resolved by accepting the versions from `main` (which came from PR #35), as those have already been reviewed and merged. The implementations in main are:

1. **src/lib/supabase.js**: Uses `isTest` detection with `import.meta.env.VITEST` and exports functions properly
2. **src/tests/setup.ts**: Uses `vi.stubGlobal` and `Object.assign(import.meta.env, ...)` pattern
3. **vitest.config.ts**: Uses `path.resolve(process.cwd(), './src')` for alias resolution

## Actions Taken
1. Checked out PR #36's branch (`copilot/create-wsl-test-setup-pr`)
2. Replaced the three conflicting files with versions from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main -- src/lib/supabase.js src/tests/setup.ts vitest.config.ts
   ```
3. Committed the changes locally

## Required Action
Someone with push access needs to push the resolved commit to the `copilot/create-wsl-test-setup-pr` branch:
```bash
git checkout copilot/create-wsl-test-setup-pr
git checkout main -- src/lib/supabase.js src/tests/setup.ts vitest.config.ts
git commit -m "Resolve conflicts: use versions from main (PR #35)"
git push origin copilot/create-wsl-test-setup-pr
```

Alternatively, PR #36 can be closed since the functionality is already in `main` via PR #35.

## Verification
After pushing, verify that:
- PR #36 shows as mergeable (no conflicts)
- Tests pass: `pnpm test`
- Build succeeds: `pnpm build`
