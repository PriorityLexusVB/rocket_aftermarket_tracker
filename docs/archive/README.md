# Archive

This folder contains historical reports, fix summaries, and one-off investigation notes that used to live at the repo root.

## Why this exists

The repo previously accumulated many root-level markdown artifacts (audit reports, fix summaries, verification checklists). They’re useful for archaeology, but they make it harder to find the canonical docs.

## Canonical docs (current)

Prefer these entrypoints unless you specifically need history:

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/Aftermarket – Workspace Guardrails (DO NOT DEVIATE).instructions.md`
- `MASTER_EXECUTION_PROMPT.md`
- `docs/QUICK_START_DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `docs/DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (root)

## Organization

- `2026-01-22-root-reports/`: first batch of root-level report artifacts moved under `docs/archive/` to reduce clutter.
